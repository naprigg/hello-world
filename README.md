# hello-world
baby's first repo
Hi! I'm a recent graduate of an NSA-designated Center of Academic Excellence!
Unfortunately, pretty much every job in my area requires a TS/SCI with Poly.
So, while I wait, I'm gonna be learning Python, C++, Golang, and either C# or Java.
Here's betting I'll learn all 4 before getting the clearance, lol.
until then, time to learn!
